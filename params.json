  "body": "### Input Files\r\nTo make your genetic data available to OpenMendel, the various input files must be in a format\r\nthat OpenMendel can read. To provide OpenMendel with the information it needs to perform its analysis you must prepare the following files. An analysis option won't always need every file type.\r\n\r\n* **Control file:** Specifies the names of your data files and any optional parameters (*keywords*) for the analysis.\r\n* **Locus File:** Names and describes the genetic loci in your data.\r\n* **Pedigree File:** Gives information about your individuals, such as name, sex, family structure, and ancestry.\r\n* **Phenotype File:** Lists the available phenotypes.\r\n* **SNP Definition File:** Defines your SNPs with information such as SNP name, chromosome, position, allele names, allele frequencies. This may be a PLINK .bim format file.\r\n* **SNP Data File:** Holds the genotypes for your data set. Must be a standard binary PLINK .bed file in SNP major format. If you have a SNP data file you must have a SNP definition file.\r\n\r\n### Control files\r\nThe format of the Control file is\r\n\r\n\tKeyword = Keyword_Value(s)\r\n\r\nBelow is an example Control file to run GWAS (text after \"#\" is commented out):\r\n\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Input and Output files.\r\n\t#\r\n\tplink_input_basename = gwas 1 data\r\n\toutput_file = gwas 1 Output.txt\r\n\tmanhattan_plot_file = ManPlotOutput_1.png\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Analysis parameters.\r\n\t#\r\n\tregression = linear\r\n\tregression_formula = Trait ~ Sex\r\n\r\nIn the example above, there are five keywords. The first three specify input and output files: *plink_input_basename*, *output_file*, *manhattan_plot_file*. The last two specify analysis parameters: *regression* and *regression_formula*. The text after the '=' are the keyword values.\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\n\r\n| Keyword        | Default   | Allowed Values   |\r\n|----------------|---------|--------------|\r\n|affected_designator|\"affected\"|    |\r\n|allele_pseudo_count|0.1|    |\r\n|allele_separator|\"/\\\\\" | first character is used in output    |\r\n|analysis_option|\"\"|    |\r\n|complexity_threshold|5e7|    |\r\n|disease_status|\"\"|    |\r\n|distribution|Normal() | Binomial, Gamma, Normal, Poisson   |\r\n|eliminate_genotypes|false|    |\r\n|female|Set{Any}([\"female\", \"f\", 'f', \"2\", '2', 2])|    |\r\n|field_separator|','|    |\r\n|genetic_map_function|\"Haldane\" | \"Haldane\" or \"Kosambi\"  |\r\n|link|IdentityLink()|    |\r\n|locus_file|\"\"|    |\r\n|lump_alleles|false|    |\r\n|male|Set{Any}([\"male\", \"m\", 'm', \"1\", '1', 1])|    |\r\n|new_pedigree_file|\"\"|    |\r\n|ordered_allele_separator|\"|\" | first character is used in output |\r\n|output_file|\"Mendel_Output.txt\"|    |\r\n|pedigree_file|\"\"|    |\r\n|phenotype_file|\"\"|    |\r\n|plink_input_basename|\"\"|    |\r\n|plink_output_basename|\"\"|    |\r\n|populations|Set{ASCIIString}()|    |\r\n|product_mode|true|    |\r\n|seed|1234|    |\r\n|snpdata_file|\"\"|    |\r\n|snpdefinition_file|\"\"|    |\r\n|trait|\"\"|    |\r\n|xlinked_analysis|false|    |\r\n\r\n### Locus File\r\n\r\nThe Locus File must have a header row with the fieldnames (in any order): Locus, Allele, Chromosome, Frequency. If your samples come from different populations, instead of one column lablelled Frequency, name the populations in the control file with the keyword *populations*, and give a frequency for each population, where the fieldnames are the population names specified in the control file.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n\tLocus,Allele,Chromosome,Basepairs,FemaleMorgans,MaleMorgans,European,African,Chinese\r\n\tABO,A,9,10,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.18,0.19\r\n\tABO,B,9,10,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.11,0.17\r\n\tABO,O,9,10,0.0,0.0,NA,0.71,0.64\r\n\tRh,D,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.81,1.0\r\n\tRh,d,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.39,0.19,0.0\r\n\tSNP,1,9,0,0.2,0.1,NA,NA,NA\r\n\tSNP,2,9,0,0.2,0.1,NA,NA,NA\r\n\t\r\n### Pedigree File\r\n\r\nA Pedigree file is always required. It can be in PLINK FAM file format, in which case it must have the extension .fam, or it can have the format of a required header rows with the following fieldnames (in any order): Pedigree,Person,Mother,Father,Sex,Twin, and optional columns such as populations ancestries.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n\tPedigree,Person,Mother,Father,Sex,Twin,BirthYear,Politician,European,African,Chinese,ABO,Rh,Xg,XSNP,HtMeters\r\n\tClinton,Bill,,,male,0,1946.0,true,1.0,0.0,0.0,A,+,+,2/2,1.88\r\n\tClinton,Hillary,,,female,0,1947.0,true,1.0,0.0,0.0,O,-,-,1/1,NA\r\n\tClinton,Chelsea,Hillary,Bill,female,0,1980.0,false,NA,NA,NA,A,+,-,1/2,NA\r\n\tObama,Barack,,,male,0,1961.0,true,0.5,0.5,0.0,O,+,NA,1/1,1.85\r\n\tObama,Michelle,,,female,0,1964.0,false,0.3,0.7,0.0,B,+,NA,2/2,NA\r\n\tObama,Malia,Michelle,Barack,female,0,1998.0,false,NA,NA,NA,O,-,+,1/2,NA\r\n\tObama,Sasha,Michelle,Barack,female,0,2001.0,false,NA,NA,NA,B,+,+,1/2,NA\r\n\r\n### Phenotype File\r\n\r\nFormat\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n\tLocus,Phenotype,Genotypes\r\n\tABO,A,\"A/A,A/O\"\r\n\tABO,B,\"B/B,B/O\"\r\n\tABO,AB,\"A/B\"\r\n\tABO,O,\"O/O\"\r\n\tRh,+,\"D/D,D/d\"\r\n\tRh,-,\"d/d\"\r\n\tXg,+,\"+/+,+/-\"\r\n\tXg,-,\"-/-\"\r\n\r\n###SNP Definition File\r\n\r\nDefines your SNPs with information such as SNP name, chromosome, position, allele names, allele frequencies. This may be a PLINK .bim format file.\r\n\r\n###SNP Data File\r\n\r\nHolds the genotypes for your data set. Must be a standard binary PLINK .bed file in SNP major format. If you have a SNP data file you must have a SNP definition file.\r\n\r\nThe symbol for missing data is \"\" or \"NA\". The PLINK File missing data symbols are \"0\" or \"-9\"\r\n",
